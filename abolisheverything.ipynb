    "# Abolish Everything!: Fairness in Ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Abolish Everything!**](https://nebula.tv/abolish) is a comedy show streaming on Nebula. The platform describes the show thusly: *On Abolish Everything!, comedian-abolitionists roast a pet peeve they want banned from society, while a panel of improvisers dubbed “The Political Establishment” argue on behalf of the status quo. The audience chooses their champion each episode, each of whom will come back to compete in the season finale.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula of each episode is the following:\n",
    "* The host, Chandler Dean, introduces the show and presents eight invited comedians, four of them as \"abolitionists\" and four of them as \"political establishment members\". (For the finale, there are instead eight \"abolitionists\".)\n",
    "* Chandler Dean, standing in front of a lectern, next to a screen, gives a 5-minute comedic presentation about something he would like to \"abolish\".\n",
    "* The \"political establishment\" and Chandler Dean banter for 5 minutes about his presentation’s subject.\n",
    "* Chandler Dean introduces a guest \"abolitionist\", who gives their own 5-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of banter with the \"political establishment\". This is repeated until every \"abolitionist\" has had their turn.\n",
    "* All \"abolitionists\" appear in front of the audience and Chandler Dean asks the audience to select their champion.\n",
    "* The audience’s two top choices are determined by the volume of their clapping and cheering for each \"abolitionist\".\n",
    "* The audience is asked to clap and cheer again for their two top choices. The winner is determined by the volume of their clapping and cheering. On every episode except the finale, the winner is invited to the finale."

    "While watching the show, I wondered if this way of selecting a winner was fair. My main concern was that the order of presentations would affect the audience’s selection. Would the first presentation have a bigger impact on them? With the latest presentations fresher in their memories, would audience members be more likely to select one of the last two \"abolitionists\" as their champion? Now that the finale has been released, I decided to check what the evidence says."
