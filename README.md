# statistical-analysis-reports

## Introduction

Hi! I’m Arcady Gascon-Afriat and I love statistics. I created this repository to show how statistical analysis can be applied to situations we encounter in our day to day lives, like determining if the winner of a comedic presentation contest is selected fairly or if eating a certain food on the morning of an exam helps us get better grades.

My plan is to look at simple things I encounter and find myself wondering about and write a short report about each of them.

## Reports

So far, I only wrote one:

* **abolisheverything**: In each episode of the comedy show [Abolish Everything!](https://nebula.tv/abolish), multiple comedians compete to "abolish" one of their pet peeves. The audience selects a winner, whose pet peeve is declared "abolished". My report on the shows’ first season, released between February 23 and June 15 2025, shows a 87.10% chance that, with the method used to determined the winner of each episodes, the odds of a given comedian winning depend on their place in the order in which the contestants make their pleas to have their pet peeves abolished. That said, with only 9 episodes released so far, that result should be taken with a gran of salt.
